# üîê Simple Encryption
 Simple symmetric encryption program that lets you encrypt/decrypt messages (strings). Made in C++.

It first encodes the message as base64, then uses Vigen√®re cipher with a private key to encrypt it.

The decryption process is just the opposite. It first decrypts the Vigen√®re cipher with the given private key, and then decodes the decrypted contents with base64.

We encode with base64 before running Vigen√®re cipher to obfuscate characters that could give away the type of the message we want to encrypt. For example `{` and `}` characters in JSON, or `<` and `>` characters in XML. 

### Side notes
_This encryption is neither secure nor unbreakable. It's used as more of a way to quickly obfuscate your messages._

_It is recommended that the key will not be longer than the input._

## Compilation and execution
Compile in your preferred way, for example:
```bash
g++ main.cpp
```
And then run the output file from the command line.

The format is: `[e:Encrypt|d:Decrypt]` `[MESSAGE]` `[KEY]`

Linux:
```bash
./a.out e "This is a secret. Shh..." MyKeyIsPrivate
```

Windows:
```bash
a.exe e "This is a secret. Shh..." MyKeyIsPrivate
```
